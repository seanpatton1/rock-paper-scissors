# Rock, Paper & Scissors

![Rock, Paper & Scissors responsive image](assets/readme-files/am-I-responsive.png)

I've created a rock-paper-scissors game where users compete against the computer in a fun and engaging battle. The game showcases a straightforward layout and vibrant color scheme designed to elevate the user experience. The goal of the game is to provide users with a brief and entertaining competition against the computer, where the first player to reach 10 victories wins.

The rules are simple: players choose between rock, paper, or scissors. The opponent also selects one of these three options. Remember, Rock defeats scissors, scissors defeat paper, and paper defeats rock.

## User Experience (UX)

### Project Goals

* The game page presents an inviting layout with supporting images for enhanced gameplay.

* Provide the user with a visual indication of the current score and clear game rules.

* Enable the user to view the outcome through an on-screen message once a selection is made.

### User Stories

* As a customer, I desire a clear indication of how to play the game.

* As a customer, I want to be aware of both my score and the computer's score.

* As a customer, I desire an attractive color scheme and layout.

* As a customer, I want an end game result or target score to aim for.

### Color Scheme


### Typography

I have selected Josefin Sans for the entirety of the website. On the game page, the font styling varies, with bolder fonts used for the score area. The same bold styling is applied to the game buttons and the game rules in the footer. I have chosen this font as I felt it went well within a game but also easily legible. I chose this over others to ensure it was easier for as many people as possible.

### Basic Design

I've outlined the design on pen and paper, creating multiple versions before finalizing the current live project. The design was focused on ensuring everything is within view of the user, including specific adjustments for the mobile view to accommodate the placement of the user's hand while holding the phone.

## Features

### General

* The colour scheme chosen consists on is green and blue with black and white fonts. I have used a linear gradient for the background combining the green and blue. 

* The website has been optimized to function seamlessly across multiple screen sizes, from mobile and tablet to desktop computers, utilizing responsive design. It adjusts the page layout according to the user's device to cater to as many users as possible.

* **Header**

![Header](assets/readme-files/header.png)

- Font size adjusts as the screen sizes grows

- As this is a standalone page there are no nav links in the header

* **Footer**

### Game page
