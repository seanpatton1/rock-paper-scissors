# Rock, Paper & Scissors

![Rock, Paper & Scissors responsive image](assets/readme-files/am-I-responsive.png)

I've developed a rock-paper-scissors game where users compete against the computer to be the first to reach 10 points. The game features a simple layout and vibrant color scheme to enhance the user experience.

## User Experience (UX)

### Project Goals

* The game page presents an inviting layout with supporting images for enhanced gameplay.

* Provide the user with a visual indication of the current score and clear game rules.

* Enable the user to view the outcome through an on-screen message once a selection is made.

### User Stories

* As a customer, I desire a clear indication of how to play the game.

* As a customer, I want to be aware of both my score and the computer's score.

* As a customer, I desire an attractive color scheme and layout.

* As a customer, I want an end game result or target score to aim for.

### Color Scheme


### Typography

I have selected Josefin Sans for the entirety of the website. On the game page, the font styling varies, with bolder fonts used for the score area. The same bold styling is applied to the game buttons and the game rules in the footer.

### Basic Design

I've outlined the design on pen and paper, creating multiple versions before finalizing the current live project. The design was focused on ensuring everything is within view of the user, including specific adjustments for the mobile view to accommodate the placement of the user's hand while holding the phone.

## Features

### General

* The colour scheme chosen consists on is green and blue with black and white fonts. I have used a linear gradient for the background combining the green and blue. 

* The website has been optimized to function seamlessly across multiple screen sizes, from mobile and tablet to desktop computers, utilizing responsive design. It adjusts the page layout according to the user's device to cater to as many users as possible.

* **Header**

!

- Font size adjusts as the screen sizes grows

- As this is a standalone page there are no nav links in the header

* **Footer**

!

- The footer give the user the rules of the game.

### Game page

!

- I have utilized images from [Pinterest](https://in.pinterest.com/pin/747879081845727421/) to user for the game images. I have then split these up to display as the user selects their choice.
